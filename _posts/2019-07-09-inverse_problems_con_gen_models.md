This is a raw snippet:

```
hello world
123
This is a text snippet
```
<!-- ![edit]({{ site.img_path }}/inverseProblems/cVAEholo.gif) -->
<img src="{{ site.img_path }}/inverseProblems/cVAEholo.gif" width="50%">

This is a JavaScript snippet:

```
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const minus = (a, b) => a - b

console.log(add(100,200))  // 300
console.log(minus(100,200))  // -100
```

This is a Python snippet:

```
def say_hello():
    print("hello world!")

say_hello()   // "hello world!"
```

Side note comment: applied a bug fix similar to [this commit](https://github.com/Atlas7/atlas7.github.io/commit/6659f4a47f6ec66987adb0f683a9c6f3842252ae#diff-818954a41dbfb01af70050a459c603b9) to ensure code snippet does not collapse unexpectly upon clicking on it. This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/jarrekk/Jalpc/issues/97).
